<h1 style="font-size:1.4em; text-align:center;">Pizza</h1>

<p style="font-size:1.4em; text-align:center;line-height: 2.5;margin-right: 20px;">Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Italian Americans migrating from East to West brought with them their crusty, delicious dish. From there, the American version exported to the rest of the world. </a></div>
